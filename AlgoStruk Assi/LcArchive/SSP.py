#shortest path problem in a graph
#find the shortest path from a source to a destination
#using bfs
#time complexity is O(V+E)
#space complexity is O(V)
#graph data structure
#graph is represented as an adjacency list
#graph is a dictionary
#key is a node
#value is a list of neighbours
#graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [0, 3, 4], 2: [0, 5], 3: [1], 4: [1], 5: [2]}
#source node
#src = 0
